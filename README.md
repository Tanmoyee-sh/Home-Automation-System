#Home Automation System
Smart home automation systems are becoming increasingly popular as technology advances, allowing homeowners to operate their home equipment remotely via smartphones or computers. This project presents an Arduino-based system that provides a low-cost solution for automating and controlling various home appliances using sensors. The system features an LED control feature activated by a motion sensor and an IR remote to control three other lights, a sound and smoke detector that sets off an alarm, and an LCD display that shows notifications. An Android app is also being developed to remotely monitor smoke, gas, and temperature within the house.

The Arduino board is a fantastic platform for DIY enthusiasts and amateurs who want to automate and control various home appliances. The Arduino-based smart home automation system, which uses microcontrollers, provides homeowners with the flexibility and convenience of remotely controlling their home appliances, making it an interesting component of smart home automation.
